# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Tasks

* 0-A function that creates a binary tree node
* 1-A function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
* 2-A function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
* 3-A function that deletes an entire binary tree
* 4-A function that checks if a node is a leaf
* 5-A function that checks if a given node is a root
* 6-A function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
* 7-A function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
* 8-A function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
* 9-A function that measures the height of a binary tree
* 10-A function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
* 11-A function that measures the size of a binary tree
* 12-A function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
* 13-A function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
* 14-A function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
* 15-A function that checks if a binary tree is full
* 16-A function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
* 17-A function that finds the sibling of a node
* 18-A function that finds the uncle of a node
